# The Data Stewardship Knowledgebase Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as project and community managers (also referred to as "maintainers" or "administrators") pledge to make participation in our projects and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language;
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences;
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism;
* Focusing on what is best for the community;
* Taking the time to understand other's actual points of view;
* Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances;
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks;
* Public or private harassment;
* Engaging in "Help Vampirism", i.e. immediately asking for help or advice without first using available self-help tools, such as Web search engines;
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission from the individuals in question;
* Posting, endorsing or otherwise suggesting malicious contents, including malicious code, projects that support or promote copyright infringment, and/or other illegal activities of any kind.
* Using the community strictly for personal gain, such as by posting advertisements of one's own projects or endeavours in the public spaces of the project.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the organization, project or its community in public spaces.
Examples of representing a the organization, project or its community include using an official organization e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by Maintainers in a case-by-case basis.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Maintainers (see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/MrHedmad/data-stewardship-knowledgebase/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file) for the list of maintainers and their contact information.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
The maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the organization leadership.

## Appointment and dismissal of new Maintainers

A new maintainer may be appointed by an unanimous vote by all current maintainers.
This vote will be held publicly by the current maintainers.
A maintainer may be removed from the position by a public vote of the majority of the other maintainers.
A maintainer may at any moment recuse themselves from the position via a public message to the other maintainers and the community.

In the eventuality that no maintainers are present, the last maintainer will retain the access rights to the repositories and other online spaces, but such spaces will be closed and repositories archived.
The last maintainer reserves the right to re-open the project at any moment, becoming the sole active maintainer.

## Changes to this Code of Conduct

Significant changes to this code of conduct must be reviewed and approved by at least 75% of the current maintainers before being enacted trough a public vote.

## Acknowledgements

All meaningful contributions, regardless of scope or importance, will be publicly acknowledged in a pre-determined project space.
The maintainers have the responsibility of making sure such acknowledgements are given when necessary.
It is an individual right to be omitted from such lists, if the contributor in question wishes to be removed.s
