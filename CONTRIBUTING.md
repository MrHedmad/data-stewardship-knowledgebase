- You should understand how the pull request process works. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

You are also required to:

  - You can read more about git configuration [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

You might find [this comprehensive guide for git and github](https://wpmudev.com/blog/the-non-developers-guide-to-git-and-github/) useful.

## Getting Started
To get started with contributing, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. Read more about forking [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes. Give it a descriptive name that reflects the changes you are making. For example, if you are adding a new link about FAIR data in the humanities, you could name your branch `add-FAIR-humanities`.
4. Make your changes in your local copy of the repository.
5. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages. To read more about writing good commit messages, check out [this guide](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). The git commit messages are the changelog of the project. It's worth spending some time to write them well.
6. Push your changes to your forked repository.
7. Submit a pull request to the main repository. You can read more in the next section.

## Submitting a Pull Request
When you're ready to submit your changes, follow these steps:
1. Make sure your forked repository is up to date with the latest changes from the main repository.
  - You can merge the latest changes from the main repository into your forked repository by following [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork).
4. Click the "New pull request" button in your forked repository.
5. Provide a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
  - For example, "Add new links about FAIR data in the humanities".
6. Include a detailed description of the changes you made and why they are necessary.
  - For example, you might write about why you feel that this addition is important, how it fits into the existing content, and any other relevant information.
7. Wait for feedback from the maintainers and be prepared to make further changes if requested.
  - Someone will check your pull request and might provide feedback. If the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.
8. Once your pull request is merged, you can delete the branch you created for the changes, and even delete your forked repository if you no longer need it.
