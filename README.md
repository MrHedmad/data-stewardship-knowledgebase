The Data Stewardship Knowledgebase attempts to act as a hub for Data stewardship knowledge scattered throughout the internet.

Links are tagged with emojis. You can check what they mean with the [Emoji Key](emoji_key.md).

The first draft links of the DSK were extracted from the slides that can be found in https://zenodo.org/records/11199741, originally from Dr. Elena Giglia (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4927-2632).

# Contributing

> [!NOTE]
> A dump of all the links from prof. Giglia's slides can be found in [dump.md](dump.md). It's being gradually sorted into the respective sections.

## Roadmap
This section highlights the most salient milestones of the DSK:
- [ ] Define the scope of the DSK and its overall structure.
- [X] Create a core collection of resources important for Data Stewards.
- [ ] Label and sort the core collection into categories.
- [ ] Convert the DSK to a dedicated platform (e.g. a website) that is better suited for consumption.
- [ ] Start curating the resources through time with scheduled reviews and automatic link health checks.
