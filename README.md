## Welcome
Welcome to the Data Stewardship Knowledgebase Github repository!
These pages contain all the source code used to rebuild the DSK website.

If you're here to read the DSK, go to [dsk.hedmad.eu](https://dsk.hedmad.eu/) instead.
If you're here to contribute to the DSK, thank you!
Keep reading on to learn how to contribute, get recognition and more.

## What is this?
The Data Stewardship Knowledgebase attempts to act as a hub for Data stewardship knowledge scattered throughout the internet.

The idea for the DSK came from the Data Stewardship course held at the University of Torino in 2024 (see [here](https://hpc4ai.unito.it/cuap-data-steward/)).
Many resources relevant for data stewards are scattered around in the internet, and can be a bother to find.
Here, we gather all of them in an integrated, useful object.

The first draft links of the DSK were extracted from the slides that can be found in https://zenodo.org/records/11199741, originally from Dr. Elena Giglia (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4927-2632).

# Contributing

This project is useless if it does not take into account everyone's opinions and contributions.
For a full guide on how to contribute, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

> [!NOTE]
> A dump of all the links from prof. Giglia's slides can be found in [dump.md](dump.md). It's being gradually sorted into the respective sections.

## Roadmap
This section highlights the most salient milestones of the DSK:
- [ ] Define the scope of the DSK and its overall structure.
- [X] Create a core collection of resources important for Data Stewards.
- [ ] Label and sort the core collection into categories.
- [ ] Convert the DSK to a dedicated platform (e.g. a website) that is better suited for consumption.
- [ ] Start curating the resources through time with scheduled reviews and automatic link health checks.
