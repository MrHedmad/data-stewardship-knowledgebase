The Data Stewardship Knowledgebase attempts to act as a hub for Data stewardship knowledge scattered throughout the internet.

The first draft links of the DSK were extracted from the slides that can be found in https://zenodo.org/records/11199741, originally from Dr. Elena Giglia (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4927-2632)

Links are tagged with emojis. You can check what they mean with the [Emoji Key](emoji_key.md).

To contribute, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

> [!NOTE]
> I'm currently in the process of adding link tags and sorting through all the links.

> [!NOTE]
> A dump of all the links from prof. Giglia's slides can be found in [dump.md](dump.md). It's being gradually sorted into the respective sections.

The DSK is split up into broad topics:
- [Open Science](/topics/open_science/README.md);
- [Research Data Management](/topics/data_management/README.md);
- [Legal aspects of data](/topics/legal/README.md);
- [Computer Science concepts](/topics/computer_science/README.md);
- [FAIR and FAIRification](/topics/FAIR/README.md);

You can access each one by clicking on the links above.
Other related sub-categories are linked in the respective sections.
