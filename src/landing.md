> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Data Stewardship Knowledgebase is under construction. Expect empty pages, warning signs, and hammers and nails left on the floor. It also might change drastically without notice.

The Data Stewardship Knowledgebase attempts to act as a hub for Data stewardship knowledge scattered throughout the internet.
It's aimed at Data Stewards, people wanting to become Data Stewards, and people interested in responsible scientific data management.
It is meant to be browsed based on your interests or to get specific help.

The first draft links of the DSK were extracted from the slides that can be found in [https://zenodo.org/records/11199741](https://zenodo.org/records/11199741), originally from [Dr. Elena Giglia](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4927-2632).

- [ ] Create a core collection of resources important for Data Stewards.
- [ ] Label and sort the core collection into categories.
- [ ] Convert the DSK to a dedicated platform (e.g. a website) that is better suited for consumption.
- [ ] Start curating the resources through time with scheduled reviews and automatic link health checks.
