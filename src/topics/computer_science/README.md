# Computer Science toolbox

In the modern day, data is almost always manipulated digitally in some form.
Even physical objects might be listed in a digital index, or scanned and digitalized altogether.
For this reason, a Data Steward has to have some computer science knowlege and a toolbox of digital hammers and wrenches which are useful when dealing with digital data.
This section covers topics such as:
- What digital data is;
- How digital data is encoded, transmitted and shared with others;
- What formats are available to save data in;
- What is metadata and in which formats are available to represent it;
- What data infrastructures are and how to manage them (as potential administrators);
- Technologies to manipulate, reshape, fuse and split data;
- Determination of costs related to data management (e.g. storage and computing power);
- Knowledge of relevant tools that can be used to obtain, reshape, reuse, manipulate and share data throughout a research project.
