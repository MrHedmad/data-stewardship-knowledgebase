# Open Science

The profession of Data Steward, and the concept of meaningful, useful data stewardship for the benefit of the community is the culmination of years of Open Science philosophy.
This section aims to explore the aspects of Open Science, in particular in the context of data management.
It covers topics such as:
- What Open Science is;
- Why is Open Science the right direction for researchers and research institutions to take;
- What could go wrong if Open Science is implemented badly;
- What do Data Stewards do in the context of Open Science;
- How to efficiently teach Open Science concepts to others;
- Why data and data stewardship matters so much for Open Science;
- Why a third party (like a researcher) might be interested in implementing Open Science and Data Stewardship policies;

## What is Open Science?

> [!TIP] Definition
> Open science is a set of principles and practices that aim to make scientific research from all fields accessible to everyone for the benefits of scientists and society as a whole. Open science is about making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable and sustainable.

    - Under the methodology section, the grant specifies that applicants should "Describe how appropriate open science practices are implemented as an integral part of the proposed methodology. Show how the choice of practices and their implementation are adapted to the nature of your work, in a way that will increase the chances of the project delivering on its objectives [e.g. 1 page]. If you believe that none of these practices are appropriate for your project, please provide a justification here."
