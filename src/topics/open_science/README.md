# Open Science

> [!TIP] Definition
> Open science is a set of principles and practices that aim to make scientific research from all fields accessible to everyone for the benefits of scientists and society as a whole. Open science is about making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable and sustainable.

### Open Access
This section includes resources specifically about Open Access.

- :office: [Berlin declaration on Open Access](https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration)
  - The founding document of the Open Access movement, it delineates the requirement to move away from paywalled content in the era of the internet towards Open Access. It defines what Open Access is, and how to support the transition to the open paradigm.
- :cookie: ScienceOpen - [Open Access Survey results](https://blog.scienceopen.com/2021/10/open-access-survey-results/)
    - A survey of 60 researchers about Open Access.The low number of respondents makes the results not very reliable.
    - Sampling strategy is also not clear. This may have been a convenience sample, on people who participated in a ScienceOpen event, making the results not generalizable.
- :bookmark_tabs: [Shift academic culture through publication](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.11415.2), an article discussing how exploitative publishers are a problem, especially discriminating poorer researchers.

Sherpa helps authors decide where to publish, including services that compile what their rights are after publication. See :hammer: [About Sherpa](https://jisc.ac.uk/sherpa) for an overview:
- :hammer: [Sherpa Romeo](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/): what are the archiving polices of different journal publishers? An author can go here to learn how to open up their articles, even when publishing in a closed-access journal.
- :hammer: [Sherpa Juliet](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/): what are the publishing requirements of funding agencies? Authors can check the publishing requirements based on who funds their research.
- :hammer: [Sherpa Fact](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/fact/): combining data from Romeo and Juliet, it shows if journals are compliant with best publishing practices.

Some universities provide open access publishing services. An example is :it: [Sirio](https://www.ojs.unito.it/), for the University of Turin.

So called "hybrid journals" provide both open access and closed access articles. They are :office: [generally regarded are bad for open access](https://www.coalition-s.org/why-hybrid-journals-do-not-lead-to-full-and-immediate-open-access/).


## Preprints
A *Preprint* is an article ready to be sent for peer reivew. Such versions of the articles :bookmark_tab: [usually differ little with their peer-reviewed counterparts](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00799-018-0234-1), and are therefore a valid open alternative to reading regular articles.

The coronavirus pandemic required immediate action. Preprints were essential for this, as they provided immediate knowledge to the public.
- :bookmark_tab: [Tracking changes between preprints and postprints during the coronavirus](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001285) highlights how not much changes between preprint and published article during peer review.

## Evaluation of research performance
The discussion of how to evaluate research performance is a key aspect of Open Science. A key driver in the current publication system is the fact that researchers are evaluated based on the rankings of the journals they publish in, rather than the quality of their research. This section includes resources that discuss the current evaluation system and how it can be improved.

- :office: :judge: :it: ANVUR - [Classificazione delle riviste](https://www.anvur.it/attivita/asn/asn-2018-2020/)
    - The Italian National Agency for the Evaluation of Universities and Research Institutes (ANVUR) has a list of journals classified by scientific area and ranked fro best to worst.
