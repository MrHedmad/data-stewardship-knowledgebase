This page collects some information about open science organizations together with a brief description, their motives and goals, and the services they offer.

## Coalition S
cOAlition S is an organization built around "Plan S", a committment to make all articles written on publicly-funded research Open Access, effective immediately. You can read more [on the cOAlition S about page](https://www.coalition-s.org/about/) and on :memo: [Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/why-plan-s/).
- The :small_red_triangle_down: :office: [Coalition S preamble](https://www.coalition-s.org/wp-content/uploads/cOAlitionS_Preamble.pdf) is the founding document of the coalition, with all considerations made when creating it plus its goals.

## COARA
COARA, the **Co**alition for **A**dvancing **R**esearch **A**ssessment, is an organization striving to reform the methods for research assessment in accordance to :curly_loop: [Open Science](./index.md) principles.

In particular, they aim to find methods to reward all types of research outputs, not only publications and patents.

COARA is a coordinated group effort divided in :newspaper: [COARA National Chapters](https://coara.eu/news/building-a-stronger-network-coara-national-chapters-convene-for-a-first-exchange-forum/) and :newspaper: [COARA Working groups](https://coara.eu/news/latest-updates-on-coara-working-groups-activities/).
The [COARA Website](https://coara.eu/) is the access point of all resources for the COARA initiative.

- Stakeholder may sign the ":star: :memo: [COARA - Full text agreement](https://coara.eu/agreement/the-agreement-full-text/)" in order to participate. It defines concrete goals, such as the creation of action plans.
  - [What are Action Plans](https://coara.eu/agreement/action-plan/) and published [COARA action plans on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/coara_action_plans/)
  - :memo: :small_red_triangle_down: COARA - See Annex 4 of the full text for useful practical tools and options to consider when dealing with research assessment: [Annex 4 of the full text agreement](https://coara.eu/app/uploads/2022/09/2022_07_19_rra_agreement_final.pdf)
  - A list of all signatories of the agreement is available in the [signatories page of the COARA website](https://coara.eu/agreement/signatories/)
- Origins of COARA:
  - The COARA funding document by the European commission: :office: :closed_book: [European commission report - 2021 - Towards a reform of the research assessment system](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/36ebb96c-50c5-11ec-91ac-01aa75ed71a1)
  - :office: :closed_book: 2021 - [Outcomes of proceedings](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14308-2021-INIT/en/pdf), on research evaluation;
  - :office: :closed_book: 2018 - [Commission Recommendations on access and preservation of scientific information](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/2ea66d3f-649a-11e8-ab9c-01aa75ed71a1)

COARA and the force behind it has produced some changes:

  - :newspaper: [Additional information](https://erc.europa.eu/news-events/news/evaluation-research-proposals-why-and-what-ercs-recent-changes)

- :newspaper: [Sorbona ditches WOS](https://www.roars.it/la-sorbona-adotta-open-alex-e-interrompe-labbonamento-a-web-of-science/)
- :newspaper: [DORA case studies](https://sfdora.org/dora-case-studies/) on the implementation of alternative metrics
- :hammer: [Reformscape](https://sfdora.org/reformscape/), an overview of ongoing changes and policies in research evaluation. Works a bit like a search engine.

Alternative metric sources, detached from canonical publishers and publishing in general are crucial for COARA. Here are a few tools and resources built for that regard:
  - :hammer: [Leiden Open Ranking](https://open.leidenranking.com/), for the scientific performance of universities, publication-centric.
  - :hammer: [Open Alex](https://openalex.org/), a non-profit organization that indexes publications. Similar to Elsevier's Scopus and Clarivate's Web of Science, Open Alex is an open, transparent replacement.
  - :hammer: [Open Citations](https://opencitations.net/index) provides a public, free index of citations (which papers cite which) for bibliometric and research purposes. It is chiefly useful for other applications that query its underlying knowledge graph (e.g. through SPARQL).
