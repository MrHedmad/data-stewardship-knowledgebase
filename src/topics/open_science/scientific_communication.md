    - This article discusses the principles of the self-journal of Science, a new publishing model that aims to bring ethics and freedom to scientific publishing.

### Open Access
This section includes resources specifically about Open Access.

- :office: [Berlin declaration on Open Access](https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration)

- :cookie: ScienceOpen - [Open Access Survey results](https://blog.scienceopen.com/2021/10/open-access-survey-results/)
    - A survey of 60 researchers about Open Access.The low number of respondents makes the results not very reliable.
    - Sampling strategy is also not clear. This may have been a convenience sample, on people who participated in a ScienceOpen event, making the results not generalizable.
- :bookmark_tabs: [Shift academic culture through publication](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.11415.2), an article discussing how exploitative publishers are a problem, especially discriminating poorer researchers.

Sherpa helps authors decide where to publish, including services that compile what their rights are after publication. See :hammer: [About Sherpa](https://jisc.ac.uk/sherpa) for an overview:
- :hammer: [Sherpa Romeo](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/): what are the archiving polices of different journal publishers? An author can go here to learn how to open up their articles, even when publishing in a closed-access journal.
- :hammer: [Sherpa Juliet](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/): what are the publishing requirements of funding agencies? Authors can check the publishing requirements based on who funds their research.
- :hammer: [Sherpa Fact](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/fact/): combining data from Romeo and Juliet, it shows if journals are compliant with best publishing practices.

Some universities provide open access publishing services. An example is :it: [Sirio](https://www.ojs.unito.it/), for the University of Turin.

So called "hybrid journals" provide both open access and closed access articles. They are :office: [generally regarded are bad for open access](https://www.coalition-s.org/why-hybrid-journals-do-not-lead-to-full-and-immediate-open-access/).


## Preprints
A *Preprint* is an article ready to be sent for peer reivew. Such versions of the articles :bookmark_tab: [usually differ little with their peer-reviewed counterparts](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00799-018-0234-1), and are therefore a valid open alternative to reading regular articles.

The coronavirus pandemic required immediate action. Preprints were essential for this, as they provided immediate knowledge to the public.
- :bookmark_tab: [Tracking changes between preprints and postprints during the coronavirus](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001285) highlights how not much changes between preprint and published article during peer review.
