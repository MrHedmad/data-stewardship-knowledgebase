    - There are no reasons. This is a joke paper.
- Dr. Glaucomflecken's videos on :cookie: :arrow_forward: [Academic Publishing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukAkG6c_N4M) and :cookie: :arrow_forward: [How to publish a manuscript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx71U3u--qU)

Publishers can be very protective about the published data: it makes them a lot of money. See for instance, the case of [Researchgate v publishers](https://www.enago.com/academy/researchgate-gets-sued-copyright-infringement/), [Researchgate bows to publishers](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/researchgate-bows-to-pressure-from-publishers-on-copyrighted-material/3008288.article) and [Researchgate announcement on the topic](https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/a-note-on-recent-content-takedowns).
