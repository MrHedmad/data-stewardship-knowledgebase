# Policy and legal issues

The administration of data, especially personal data, may be subject (or should be subjected) to laws.
This section aims to aggregate such concepts and make a data steward both aware of them and capable of dealing with them.
It covers topics such as:
- National and International privacy laws regarding personal data;
- Legal issues when reusing other’s code and data;
- Ethical concerns of releasing, reusing and otherwise manipulating data;
- Determining the ethical and legal risks related to handling specific types of data;
- How to give recognition when reusing a piece of data produced by others;
- Creation of effective Open Science policies and plans of action for groups and organizations;
- Fulfilling Open Science/Data Stewardship requirements for funding bodies that require them (i.e. DMPs);
- The soft skills required for effective management and administration of an organization interested in implementing data stewardship practices;
