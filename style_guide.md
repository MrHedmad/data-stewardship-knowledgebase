# The Data Stewardship Knowledgebase Style Guide

To ensure consistency across the repository, the DSK follows a specific style guide. This guide is intended to help contributors understand the formatting and structure of the DSK.

The DSK is divided into several broad topics, each with its own folder. Within each topic, there are subcategories and individual files for specific resources.

Each top-level topic folder should contain a `README.md` file that serves as an introduction to the topic. This file should provide an overview of the topic and link to relevant subcategories or resources. This file should be linked in the main `README.md` file to allow easy navigation.
The topic's `README.md` file contains the main content of the topic, and generally it contains the majority of the information and links related to that topic.
Please include a table of content for easier navigation.

Each top-category `README.md` file can be accompanied by any number of additional files, which can be used to provide more detailed information or to organize resources in a more granular way.
Each of these files should be linked in the main `README.md` file in the "Specific Resources" section.

These additional notes may be collections of links, prose about a topic, or any other relevant information. They should be written in Markdown and follow the same formatting conventions as the rest of the repository.

When adding links to the DSK, please tag them following the [Emoji Key](emoji_key.md). This helps to quickly identify the type of resource being linked and provides a visual cue for users. Link tags should be placed at the beginning of the link proper, with a space between them and the start of the link.

When writing prose, please use clear and concise language. Avoid jargon or overly technical terms unless they are necessary for understanding the content. If you are unsure about the clarity of your writing, consider asking for feedback from other contributors. Provide links to external resources where appropriate to help readers learn more about a topic
